# Predicting Falcon 9 First-Stage Landing Success Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the capstone project for the [IBM Applied Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone) on Coursera. The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict whether the first stage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully, supporting cost estimation and competitive analysis in the commercial space launch industry.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

SpaceX reduces launch costs by reusing the Falcon 9 first stage. Predicting landing success helps stakeholders make informed decisions. This project uses publicly available launch data to train a binary classification model for landing outcomes.
